# Basic-Machine-Learning
Implementations of core ML algorithms in python for a data mining class. Current algorithms implemented are:
- Naive-Bayes classifer
- K-means clustering
- Apriori algorithm

As of now, these algorithms can't be applied to other datasets besides the yelp-dataset provided in the files.

## UPDATE 08/18/17
I'm going to leave this repository as is, since I think it's pretty clear that this code is bad, and I don't see much reason to update this code, because there isn't any practical purpose for my implementation. The most efficient/well-written versions of these algorithms exist in frameworks already, and the code was really meant for practice in the first place.
