# Basic-Machine-Learning
This repo includes an implementation of a naive-bayes classifer, k-means clustering algorithm, and apriori algorithm implemented on a yelp dataset included in the files. I wrote these programs for an introductory class on data mining.

General usage of each of these programs are detailed within the comments of each file.
