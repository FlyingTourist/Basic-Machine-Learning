# Basic-Machine-Learning
Implementations of core ML algorithms in python. Current algorithms implemented are:
- Naive-Bayes classifer
- K-means clustering
- Apriori algorithm

As of now, these algorithms can't be applied to other datasets besides the yelp-dataset provided in the files. 

## TODO:
 - More algorithms
 - Integrating general usage for any arbitrary dataset
